### Hi there!

I am a Machine Learning Engineer working on AI-driven perception and navigation systems for autonomous platforms. My work focuses on applying computer vision, deep learning, and sensor fusion techniques to enable reliable operation in challenging, real-world environments.

I have developed and evaluated deep learning models for GNSS-denied navigation, integrating IMU, barometer, LiDAR, and camera data to estimate vehicle state when GPS signals are unavailable. I have also worked on vision-based sense-and-avoid systems, developing monocular object detection and multi-object tracking methods for airborne collision avoidance using large-scale, real-world datasets.

My interests included autonomous systems, computer vision, SLAM, and safety-critical AI, with a particular emphasis on robust perception and decision-making under uncertainty.

**Technologies:** C++, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS
