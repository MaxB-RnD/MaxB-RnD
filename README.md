### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** working on AI-driven navigation and perception systems. Currently, I'm developing deep learning models for **GNSS-denied navigation**, integrating sensor fusion techniques with **IMU, barometer, and camera data** to estimate positions when GPS signals are unavailable.  

Iâ€™m passionate about **autonomous systems, deep learning, and real-world AI applications**, especially in high-risk and defense environments. My work involves exploring **SLAM, sensor fusion, and deep learning** for robust navigation solutions.  

ðŸ”¹ **Interests:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Autonomous Systems, Sensor Fusion  
ðŸ”¹ **Tech Stack:** C++, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS 

Feel free to check out my work and connect! ðŸš€
